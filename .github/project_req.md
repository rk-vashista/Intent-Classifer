# üßæ **Project Requirements Document: Multi-Turn Intent Classification System**

---

## üìå **Overview**

This system processes WhatsApp-style multi-turn conversations between users and a business to predict the **final customer intent** and generate a **human-readable rationale**. It takes a JSON file with chat logs and outputs both JSON and CSV files with predicted intents.

| FR004          | Intent Classification               | As a user, I want the system to classify the final customer intent from the conversation      | The system should output one of five intents: "Book Appointment", "Product Inquiry", "Pricing Negotiation", "Support Request", or "Follow-Up".   |
| FR005          | Rationale Generation                | As a user, I want to understand why a particular intent was chosen                            | The system should provide a rationale string based on the conversation content and final user message.                                           |
| FR006          | Output JSON File                    | As a user, I want to download a structured JSON file of predictions                           | The system should output a JSON file with conversation ID, predicted intent, and rationale.                                                      |
| FR007          | Output CSV File                     | As a user, I want to export the results in spreadsheet format                                 | The system should generate a CSV file with columns: `conversation_id`, `predicted_intent`, and `rationale`.                                      |
| FR008          | Batch Processing                    | As a user, I want the system to efficiently process thousands of conversations                | The system should be optimized to handle large JSON files (thousands of entries) without memory or performance issues.                           |
| FR009          | Use Open-Source Models Only         | As a reviewer, I want to ensure the solution uses free and open-source models only            | The system must use models like DistilBERT, RoBERTa, or Gemma from Hugging Face ‚Äî commercial APIs like OpenAI or Claude are strictly disallowed. |
| FR010          | Model Abstraction                   | As a developer, I want to easily switch models or fine-tune them if needed                    | The system should have modular code that supports changing or fine-tuning transformer models with minimal effort.                                |
| FR011          | Command-Line Interface (CLI)        | As a user, I want to run the tool from the command line                                       | The system should provide a Python script (or CLI command) that takes an input file and outputs results.                                         |
| FR012          | Setup Instructions and Dependencies | As a developer, I want to quickly install dependencies and run the system                     | The project should include a `requirements.txt` file and a `README.md` with clear setup and usage instructions.                                  |
| FR013          | Logging and Error Handling          | As a user, I want feedback if the input file is malformed or an error occurs during inference | The system should provide informative error messages and logs in case of invalid input or processing issues.                                     |

## üéØ **Intent Labels (Final Prediction Classes)**

The system must classify each conversation into **one** of the following categories:

1. ‚úÖ **Book Appointment** ‚Äì Customer is trying to schedule a meeting, visit, or call.
2. üîç **Product Inquiry** ‚Äì Customer is asking about features, availability, or details.
3. üí∏ **Pricing Negotiation** ‚Äì Customer is negotiating or pushing back on price.
4. üõ†Ô∏è **Support Request** ‚Äì Customer is reporting an issue or asking for help.
5. üîÅ **Follow-Up** ‚Äì Customer is following up on a past conversation or commitment.
