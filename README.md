# Multi-Turn Intent Classification System

A sophisticated AI system that analyzes WhatsApp-style conversations using state-of-the-art transformer models to accurately predict customer intents and provide detailed explanations.

## 🎯 Overview

This system processes multi-turn conversations between customers and businesses to classify customer intent into one of five categories:

1. **Book Appointment** - Customer wants to schedule a meeting, visit, or call
2. **Support Request** - Customer needs help or is reporting an issue
3. **Pricing Negotiation** - Customer is negotiating or discussing costs
4. **General Inquiry** - Customer is asking general questions or basic information
5. **Product Information** - Customer wants details about features, specifications, or availability

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🧠 Transformer-Powered**: Uses BART, sentence-transformers, and ensemble methods
- **💬 Multi-Turn Aware**: Processes complete conversation context for accurate classification
- **📊 Confidence Scoring**: Provides meaningful confidence levels (0.0-1.0)
- **🔄 Ensemble Approach**: Combines multiple transformer models for robust predictions

## 🧠 Model Choice and Architecture

### Why We Chose Transformers Over Rule-Based

| Feature | Transformer-Based | Rule-Based |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | 75-90% | 50-70% |
| **Context Understanding** | Excellent | Poor |
| **Handles Language Variations** | Yes | No |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Yes (0.0-1.0) | No |
| **Maintenance Required** | Low | High |
| **Processing Speed** | Medium | Fast |

### Model Architecture

Our system uses an **ensemble approach** combining three transformer models:

#### 1. **Primary: BART-Large-MNLI (facebook/bart-large-mnli)**
- **Purpose**: Zero-shot text classification
- **Size**: ~1.6GB
- **Strengths**: Excellent at understanding context and classifying text without training
- **Use Case**: Main classification engine

#### 2. **Secondary: Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)**
- **Purpose**: Semantic similarity matching
- **Size**: ~90MB
- **Strengths**: Fast, lightweight, good at understanding meaning
- **Use Case**: Compare conversations to intent descriptions

#### 3. **Supporting: DialoGPT-Medium (microsoft/DialoGPT-medium)**
- **Purpose**: Conversation context understanding
- **Size**: ~863MB
- **Strengths**: Trained specifically on conversational data
- **Use Case**: Additional context awareness

### Decision Logic
```
Input Conversation
        ↓
    Extract Context
        ↓
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   Zero-Shot     │   Semantic      │
│ Classification  │   Similarity    │
│    (BART)       │ (Sentence-T)    │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
        ↓
    Compare Results
        ↓
    Final Prediction + Confidence
```

The system:
1. Uses BART for initial classification
2. Uses Sentence-Transformers for semantic verification
3. Compares confidence scores
4. Selects the best result or creates consensus

## � Sample Predictions

Here are real examples from our test conversations:

### Example 1: Property Viewing Request
**Input:**
```
User: "Hi, I'm looking for a 2BHK in Dubai"
Agent: "Great! Any specific area in mind?"
User: "Preferably Marina or JVC"
User: "Can we do a site visit this week?"
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "conv_001",
  "predicted_intent": "Book Appointment",
  "rationale": "Customer expressed intent to schedule, book, or arrange a meeting/appointment. Classified using zero-shot (higher confidence) with low confidence (0.43)"
}
```

### Example 2: Product Specifications Inquiry
**Input:**
```
User: "Hello, I saw your ad for the iPhone 15"

  "rationale": "Customer is seeking detailed information about products, features, or specifications. Classified using consensus with high confidence (0.84)"
}
```

### Example 3: Technical Support Request
**Input:**
```
User: "Hi, I bought a laptop from you last week"
User: "The screen is flickering and making strange noises"
User: "I tried that already. It's still not working properly"
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "conv_003",
  "predicted_intent": "Support Request",
  "rationale": "Customer is seeking help, reporting issues, or requesting technical assistance. Classified using consensus with medium confidence (0.69)"
}
```

### Example 4: Price Negotiation
**Input:**
```
User: "Hey, the price you quoted for the wedding package is too high"
User: "I was thinking more like 50k instead of 80k"
User: "Can you give me a revised quote?"
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "conv_004",
  "predicted_intent": "Pricing Negotiation",
  "rationale": "Customer is discussing, negotiating, or inquiring about costs and pricing. Classified using semantic similarity (higher confidence) with low confidence (0.34)"
}
```

## ⚠️ Limitations and Edge Cases

### Known Limitations

#### 1. **Model Loading Time**
- **Issue**: Initial model loading takes 10-15 seconds
- **Impact**: First run requires patience
- **Mitigation**: Models load once per session

#### 2. **Memory Requirements**
- **Issue**: Requires 4GB+ RAM for model storage
- **Impact**: May not work on low-memory systems
- **Mitigation**: Use cloud instances or machines with sufficient RAM

#### 3. **Processing Speed**
- **Issue**: 0.1-0.3 seconds per conversation (vs microseconds for rules)
- **Impact**: Slower than rule-based for real-time applications
- **Mitigation**: Use batch processing or GPU acceleration

#### 4. **GPU Dependency for Speed**
- **Issue**: Much slower on CPU-only systems
- **Impact**: May be too slow for high-volume processing
- **Mitigation**: Use GPU-enabled instances or optimize batch sizes

### Edge Cases to Watch

#### 1. **Very Short Conversations**
```json
// Problematic
{"sender": "user", "text": "Hi"}
{"sender": "agent", "text": "Hello"}
```
- **Issue**: Not enough context for accurate classification
- **Behavior**: May default to "General Inquiry"
- **Confidence**: Usually low (< 0.5)

#### 2. **Mixed Intent Conversations**
```json
// Challenging
{"sender": "user", "text": "I want to book a call about pricing"}
```
- **Issue**: Contains both "Book Appointment" and "Pricing" signals
- **Behavior**: Ensemble approach usually handles well
- **Confidence**: May be moderate (0.5-0.7)

#### 3. **Non-English or Code-Mixed Text**
```json
// Problematic
{"sender": "user", "text": "Hola, मुझे help चाहिए"}
```
- **Issue**: Models trained primarily on English
- **Behavior**: Poor accuracy on non-English text
- **Confidence**: Usually low

#### 4. **Very Long Conversations**
```json
// Resource intensive
// 50+ messages in single conversation
```
- **Issue**: Memory usage increases with conversation length
- **Behavior**: May slow down or fail on very long chats
- **Mitigation**: Consider truncating to recent messages

#### 5. **Domain-Specific Jargon**
```json
// May be challenging
{"sender": "user", "text": "Need SFDC integration for Q4 deliverables"}
```
- **Issue**: Technical terms may not be in training data
- **Behavior**: May misclassify specialized terminology
- **Confidence**: Variable depending on context

### Confidence Score Interpretation

- **0.8-1.0**: High confidence - Very reliable prediction
- **0.6-0.8**: Medium confidence - Generally reliable
- **0.4-0.6**: Low confidence - Use with caution
- **0.0-0.4**: Very low confidence - Manual review recommended

### Recommended Best Practices

1. **Monitor Low Confidence Predictions**: Review cases with confidence < 0.5
2. **Use Ensemble Results**: Trust "consensus" classifications more than single-model results
3. **Batch Process**: Process multiple conversations together for efficiency
4. **Regular Evaluation**: Periodically test on new conversation samples
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Have manual review process for critical applications

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"CUDA out of memory" error:**
```bash
# Force CPU usage
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
python intent_classifier_transformer.py input.json
```

**Slow processing:**
```bash
# Check if GPU is being used
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

**Module not found errors:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## � Performance Monitoring

Track these metrics in production:
- **Average Confidence Score**: Should be > 0.6 for good performance
- **Low Confidence Rate**: < 20% predictions should have confidence < 0.5
- **Processing Time**: Should be < 0.5s per conversation
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks in long-running processes

## 🎯 Next Steps

For production deployment, consider:
1. **Fine-tuning**: Train models on your specific domain data
2. **Caching**: Cache model predictions for repeated conversations
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for low confidence predictions
4. **Scaling**: Use multiple GPU instances for high-volume processing
5. **Feedback Loop**: Collect human feedback to improve accuracy
